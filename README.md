# Quick start

```bash
yarn
yarn keycloak # Build the theme one time (some assets will be copied to 
              # public/keycloak_static, they are needed to dev your page outside of Keycloak)
yarn start # See the Hello World app
# You can now develop your Login pages.

# Think your theme is ready? Run
yarn keycloak
# Read the instruction printed on the console to see how to test
# your theme on a real Keycloak instance.
```
